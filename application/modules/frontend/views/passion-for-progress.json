At ZXY we are committed to social compliance, not just on the factory floor by ensuring all our partner vendors exceed standards, but much further. Our primary support is for on - going sustainable projects in the developing world, across the education, health and water sectors, as well as disaster and emergency relief schemes. These projects are located in local cities where we produce and manufacture, as well national. ZXY also supports programs in the developed world where there are also many people in need, especially in the field of health. Academic research is also underway for establishing the ZXY Foundation to be launched in 2015, for a pioneering scheme to link clients vendors in supporting local communities for a better future</div></div>"
